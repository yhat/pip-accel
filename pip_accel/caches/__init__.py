:py:mod:`pip_accel.caches` - Support for multiple cache backends
================================================================

This module defines an abstract base class (:py:class:`AbstractCacheBackend`)
to be inherited by custom cache backends in order to easily integrate them in
pip-accel. The cache backends included in pip-accel are built on top of the
same mechanism.

Additionally this module defines :py:class:`CacheManager` which makes it
possible to merge the available cache backends into a single logical cache
which automatically disables backends that report errors.

    Abstract base class for implementations of pip-accel cache backends.

    Subclasses of this class are used by pip-accel to store Python distribution
    archives in order to accelerate performance and gain independence of
    external systems like PyPI and distribution sites.

    .. note:: This base class automatically registers subclasses at definition
              time, providing a simple and elegant registration mechanism for
              custom backends. This technique uses metaclasses and was
              originally based on the article `Using Metaclasses to Create
              Self-Registering Plugins
              <http://effbot.org/zone/metaclass-plugins.htm>`_.

              I've since had to introduce some additional magic to make this
              mechanism compatible with both Python 2.x and Python 3.x because
              the syntax for metaclasses is very much incompatible and I refuse
              to write separate implementations for both :-).
